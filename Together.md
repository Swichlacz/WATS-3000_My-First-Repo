 # Unity
 ## by Violet Jacob

I dreamed that **life** and **time** and **space** were *one*,<br>
        And the pure trance of dawn;<br>
        The increase drawn<br>
    From all the journeys of the travelling sun,<br>
    And the long mysteries of sound and sight,<br>
        The whispering rains,<br>
    And far, calm waters set in lonely plains,<br>
        And cry of birds at night.<br>
        
I dreamed that these and love and death were **one**,<br>
        And all eternity,<br>
        The life to be<br>
    Therewith entwined, throughout the ages spun;<br>
    And so with **Grief**, my playmate; him I knew<br>
        One with the rest, - <br>
    One with the mounting day, the east and west - <br>
        Lord, is it true?<br>
    Lord, do I **dream**? Methinks a key unlocks<br>
    Some dungeon door, in thrall of blackened towers,<br>
    On ecstasies, half hid, like chill white flowers<br>
    **Blown** in the secret places of the rocks.<br>
    **Life**, *time*, *space*, *love*, and *death* are **equal**.
